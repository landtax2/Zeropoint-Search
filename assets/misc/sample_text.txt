Patient Name: John Bacon
Date of Birth: 05/15/1963

Date of Report: 09/01/2024

________________________________________
Chief Complaint:
Mr. John Bacon, a 61-year-old male, presented with worsening chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath. The patient was referred for cardiac evaluation following a stress test and angiogram that revealed significant coronary artery blockages.
History of Present Illness:
The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He began experiencing intermittent chest pain six months ago, which became progressively worse over the past two weeks. Symptoms included discomfort radiating to the left arm, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. Mr. Bacon was initially managed with medications, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins, but these did not adequately control his symptoms.
Cardiac Workup:
A coronary angiogram performed on 08/25/2024 showed:
•	90% stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery
•	80% stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA)
•	70% stenosis in the left circumflex artery (LCx)
Given the extent of multi-vessel disease, the patient was deemed an appropriate candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Surgical Procedure:
On 08/29/2024, Mr. Bacon underwent a successful CABG procedure. The following bypasses were performed:
•	Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the LAD
•	Saphenous vein graft to the RCA
•	Saphenous vein graft to the LCx
The surgery was uneventful, and there were no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the ICU within 6 hours postoperatively and transferred to a step-down unit on postoperative day 2.
Postoperative Course:
The patient’s recovery has been satisfactory. Pain management was achieved with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. There has been no evidence of wound infection or dehiscence, and the patient remains hemodynamically stable. Cardiac rehabilitation has been initiated, and Mr. Bacon is ambulating without assistance.
Medications on Discharge:
•	Aspirin 81 mg daily
•	Atorvastatin 40 mg daily
•	Metoprolol 25 mg BID
•	Lisinopril 10 mg daily
•	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
•	Insulin for diabetes management, as required
Follow-Up:
The patient will follow up with his cardiologist in two weeks for further evaluation and ongoing management. He has been advised to continue cardiac rehabilitation and adhere to lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, smoking cessation (if applicable), and regular exercise.
Prognosis:
The prognosis is good, assuming adherence to medication and rehabilitation protocols. The patient has been educated on recognizing symptoms of recurrence, including chest pain, and when to seek emergency care.
Discharge Date: 09/01/2024
